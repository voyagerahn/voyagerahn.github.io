          I am a B.S. student in the Mechanical Engineering department at Seoul National University of Science
          and Technology. I'm doing my internship at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology(KIST) <a
            href="https://sites.google.com/view/kist-arc/home/">Advanced Robot Control Lab</a>, AI and Robotics
          group. Currently, I focus on Machine Learning, Robotics and Optimization.

        Research
      </h3>
      <p>
        I'm interested in investigating how learning algorithms can enable robots to acquire complex skills and controlling how
        robots work these tasks well in real-world settings. 
        <!-- My research goal is thus delve into learning and interpreting deep
        representations for complex skills and enabling machines to smoothly compose and execute skills for
        hierarchical tasks. -->

      </p>

      <!-- <p>I think that conservation laws are equally applied to mechanics and circuits, and when learning engineering,
        such as vectorization of words and pixels in natural language processing and image processing, ME, EE, and CS
        are all organically connected to each other in a large framework. For this reason, I am studying without
        establishing the boundaries of engineering, and I think all of their engineering problems are the same in a
        large framework. Enjoy the process of solving problems and seek to simplify problem definition and understand
        the basic principles when solving problems. He is very interested in Robotics, which is needed by
        multidisciplinary research areas, and is currently studying Robotics, deep learning to apply to robots, and
        vision.</p> -->
